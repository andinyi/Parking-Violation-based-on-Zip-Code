## Parking Violations Based on Zip Codes of NYC

A python code that allows for the compliation of Parking Violations and displays it for each individual Zip Code in New York City. Planned to include a simple input that allows for users to specify which street they're interested in to further return the Parking Violations in proportion to the Average Daily Traffic Count.

### Data Visualization

A image of the generated HTML file for the created visualization of NYC organized by Zip Code. It contain's the Zip Code of the highlighted area as well as the Parking Violations 
in that area as a caption/popup as you hover over it. At the moment the current Map only show's the Zip Code but the later version will also include the parking violation count.

### Planned

- Planned to finish the user lookup as well as the ability for users to choose a street and then return a Parking violation count over the daily average traffic.
- Planned to also include the parking violation as a tooltip.
- Hopefully work a bit more on the website to see if I could make my own or include an interactive html on here as well. 

### Scuffed Honestly but do give me any feedback you can!
